Weakly supervised segmentation requires assigning a label to every pixel based on training instances with partial annotations such as image-level tags, object bounding boxes, labeled points and scribbles. This task is challenging, as coarse annotations (tags, boxes) lack precise pixel localization whereas sparse annotations (points, scribbles) lack broad region coverage. Existing methods tackle these two types of weak supervision differently: Class activation maps are used to localize coarse labels and iteratively refine the segmentation model, whereas conditional random fields are used to propagate sparse labels to the entire image.

We formulate weakly supervised segmentation as a semi-supervised metric learning problem, where pixels of the same (different) semantics need to be mapped to the same (distinctive) features. We propose 4 types of contrastive relationships between pixels and segments in the feature space, capturing low-level image similarity, semantic annotation, co-occurrence, and feature affinity They act as priors; the pixel-wise feature can be learned from training images with any partial annotations in a data-driven fashion. In particular, unlabeled pixels in training images participate not only in data-driven grouping within each image, but also in discriminative feature learning within and across images. We deliver a universal weakly supervised segmenter with significant gains on Pascal VOC and DensePose.

## Data Preparation

### Pascal VOC 2012

1. Augmented Pascal VOC training set by [SBD](http://home.bharathh.info/pubs/codes/SBD/download.html). [Download link](https://github.com/jyhjinghwang/SegSort/blob/master/dataset/voc12/sbd_clsimg.zip) provided by [SegSort](https://github.com/jyhjinghwang/SegSort). Please unzip it and put it besides the VOC2012/ folder as sbd/dataset/clsimg/.
2. Ground-truth semantic segmentation masks are reformatted as grayscale images. [Download link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fd2m7s87gk7jeyh/AAC6tN6syhFKmEaDYCwUIgnXa?dl=0) provided by [SegSort](https://github.com/jyhjinghwang/SegSort).
3. The over-segmentation masks are generated by combining contour detectors with gPb-owt-ucm. [HED-owt-ucm masks](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fd2m7s87gk7jeyh/AAC6tN6syhFKmEaDYCwUIgnXa?dl=0) provided by [SegSort](https://github.com/jyhjinghwang/SegSort).
4. Scribble and point annotations by [ScribbleSup](https://jifengdai.org/downloads/scribble_sup/). We follow ["Regularized Losses for Weakly-supervised CNN Segmentation"](https://github.com/meng-tang/rloss/blob/master/data/pascal_scribble/convertscribbles.m) to process scribble annotations. You can download the processed ground-truth scribble([100%](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R25yksUYCo59ljtuXxC9l2cd6iZFsjpW/view?usp=sharing), [80%](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A8mAFya8o22bKO-3yQuBPJR_Ki-4NFCO/view?usp=sharing), [50%](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d38S_K-y3oLUtNAa2IcjuJsmjzyEus40/view?usp=sharing) and [30%](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cV19sv0JHxEi95dUr-_fF3oXUbMztwf3/view?usp=sharing)) and [point](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13CsLen7i8aHCXpqnjkHcjrpX5wAcVJLl/view?usp=sharing) annotations, and put them under VOC2012/scribble folder. For scribbles, we set dilation size to 3; For points, we set dilation size to 6.
5. Cam annotations by [SEAM](https://github.com/YudeWang/SEAM). You can download the processed CAMs for [image tag](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bIHgMfzfiewabO57SJXA6IorknpVQUk-/view?usp=sharing) and [bounding box](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zhGAqNc3OguUfmipOyYnaXERbAwv3T_S/view?usp=sharing) annotations, and put them under VOC2012/cam. For image tags, we set `alpha` to 6 and probability threshold to 0.2. Pixels with probability less than 0.2 are considered as unlabeled regions. For bounding boxes, we normalize CAM to the range of 0 and 1 within each box, and set the probability threshold to 0.5. The pixel labels outside the boxes as background class.
